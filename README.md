# 11ty + TACHYONS

## Quickly begin prototyping using 11ty and Tachyons.

### Clone and develop locally


```npm install```

```npm start```


### Note to Jekyll users:

This template may be an ideal introduction to 11ty for you. It is structured in a manner that is similar to a Jekyll project. I recommend you to read [this article](https://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/) to get up to speed.


### Make It Your Own

1. Edit ```/_data/site.json``` which contains things such as the site name, author, Google Analytics ID, etc...
2. Go wild with Tachyons

### Tachyons

A Saas distribution of Tachyons can be found in ```/scss/```. Additional CSS can be written in ```/scss/custom.scss``` for convenience.
